### Fixed
- branch submit: Fix incorrect warning about current branch not being tracked when --no-publish is used.
- branch submit: Fix bug where updating an open PR would overwrite changes pushed to it by others. Use --force to overwrite these changes.

- branch submit: Allow Git editor to be a shell command, not just an executable name.
- {downstack, stack} edit: Use Git editor to edit list of branches.
