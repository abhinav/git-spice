## <a name="v0.7.0">v0.7.0</a> - 2024-10-02

This release contains significant changes to internal state management to prevent corruption.
If you run into any issues, please [report them here](https://github.com/abhinav/git-spice/issues/new).

### Changed
- branch delete: Accept multiple branches for deletion.
- Branch selection widget is now smarter about prioritizing fuzzy matches.
### Fixed
- branch create: Prevent creation of tracked branches with untracked bases as this leaves the storage in a corrupted state.
- repo init: Don't leave dangling branch references when trunk is changed.
- branch create: Don't commit staged changes if git-spice is unable to save the branch to its internal storage.
- branch onto: Don't rebase the branch if changing its base would corrupt the data store.
- github: Recognize remote URLs in the form `ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/org/repo`.
- repo sync: Fix case when many branches from the same stack are merged, and order of deletion causes a restacking error or conflict.
- repo sync: Reduce the number of redundant operations performed when processing multiple merged branches.
