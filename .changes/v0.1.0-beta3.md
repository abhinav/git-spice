## v0.1.0-beta3 - 2024-06-05
### Added
- branch submit: Populate default PR message with PR template, if found.
### Changed
- branch submit: Update an existing PR's draft status only if `--draft` or `--no-draft` flags are provided.
### Fixed
- branch submit: The --draft flag is no longer ignored. Whether a PR is draft or not will be changed on each submit.
- {downstack, stack} submit: Don't change draft status of existing PRs. Use `branch submit --[no-]draft` to do that.
- Fix issue where some operations printed rebase conflict message two or more times.
- rebase {continue, abort}: Heal from external `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort` and avoid running old rebase continuation commands.
- branch checkout: Fix trunk branch not showing in branch selection prompt.
