### Added
- branch select: Add ctrl+u key binding to clear filter
- submit: Add --reviewers flag and 'spice.submit.reviewers' configuration option to request review from specific users or teams upon CR submission.
- submit: Add --assign flag and 'spice.submit.assignees' configuration option to assign CRs to users upon submission.
### Fixed
- submit: --dry-run now reports which labels will be added to existing CRs.
- branch submit: Check if git configuration prevents pushed branches from being tracked, which could leave branches in a state where follow-up submits are not possible
- branch submit: Fix panic when updating CRs that have no upstream branch configured
