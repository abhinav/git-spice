## <a name="v0.21.0">v0.21.0</a> - 2025-12-05

**Release highlight**:
This release brings `--reviewer` and `--assign` flags to all submit commands.
You can now request reviews or assign CRs at creation time, or during updates to existing CRs.
Both flags have configuration variants: `spice.submit.reviewers` and `spice.submit.assignees` that are merged with flag values.

This unlocks a couple common use cases:

```bash
# Always request reviews from my team
git config spice.submit.reviewers 'example/my-team'

# Always assign submitted CRs to myself
git config spice.submit.assignees $(whoami)
```

### Added
- submit: Add --reviewer flag and 'spice.submit.reviewers' configuration option to request reviews from specific users or teams upon CR submission.
- submit: Add --assign flag and 'spice.submit.assignees' configuration option to assign CRs to users upon submission.
- Branch selection prompt now supports pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> to clear the search filter.

### Fixed
- submit: --dry-run now reports which labels will be added to existing CRs upon submission.
- branch submit: Check if the Git configuration prevents pushed branches from being tracked, which would leave those branches in a state where follow-up submits are not possible.
- branch submit: Fix panic when updating CRs that have no upstream branch configured.
