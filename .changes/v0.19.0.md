## <a name="v0.19.0">v0.19.0</a> - 2025-10-19
### Added
- Add experimental 'gs commit pick' to cherry-pick a commit and update upstack branches in one go. Opt into it with `git config --global spice.experiment.commitPick true`. The command presents an interactive prompt when invoked without any arguments. ![demo of gs commit pick](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/abhinav/git-spice/refs/heads/main/doc/tapes/20251018-commit-pick.gif)
- Add 'gs downstack track' command to track a manually created stack of branches in one go. ![demo of gs downstack track](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/abhinav/git-spice/refs/heads/main/doc/tapes/20251005-downstack-track.gif)
- {stack, upstack} restack: prompt for confirmation when invoked from trunk to prevent accidental full-repository restacking. To do this without a prompt, prefer using the `gs repo restack` command instead.
- submit: Add `spice.submit.navigationCommentStyle.marker` configuration option to customize the marker in navigation comments
### Changed
- branch create: -m/--message now implies --commit
- submit: Warn and prompt for confirmation when submitting branches with zero commits
### Fixed
- repo sync: Fix failure to delete merged branches after a sync operation because an upstack branch of the merged branch is checked out in a worktree.
