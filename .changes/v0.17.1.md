### Fixed
- log: When used without `--all`, query only requested branches internally. This was wasted work and slowed the command down in repositories with many branches.
- log: List all tracked branches when run from an untracked branch or detached HEAD. Previously, this behavior was undefined.
- Fix incorrect paths being logged when autostashed changes fail to reapply after a rebase operation.
