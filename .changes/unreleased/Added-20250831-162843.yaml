  New experimental 'gs branch fixup' command
  that acts like 'git commit --amend' for any downstack commit.
  It will commit staged changes to a specified downstack commit,
  and automatically rebase the rest of the stack on top of it.
  See <https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/cli/experiments>
  for instructions on enabling experimental features.
