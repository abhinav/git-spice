  git-spice now sets the `GIT_SPICE=1` environment variable
  for most external commands it spawns, including editors and Git itself.
  This may be used in, for example, Git hooks that need to detect
  if they are being run as part of a git-spice operation.
  For a demonstration of use, [see this recipe](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/recipes/#auto-track-branches-on-checkout).
