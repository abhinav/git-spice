## <a name="v0.23.0">v0.23.0</a> - 2026-02-02
### Added
- git-spice now sets the `GIT_SPICE=1` environment variable for most external commands it spawns, including editors and Git itself. This may be used in, for example, Git hooks that need to detect if they are being run as part of a git-spice operation. For a demonstration of use, [see this recipe](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/recipes/#auto-track-branches-on-checkout).
- Branch listings including `gs log` commands and commands that present a branch selection prompt, all now show paths for branches checked out in other worktrees.
- submit: Detect and recreate navigation comments if they are deleted externally.
- submit: Add `spice.submit.reviewers.addWhen` configuration option, which allows controlling whether reviewers configured with `spice.submit.reviewers` are added to draft change requests.
### Fixed
- gitlab: Token extraction for CLI-based authentication now supports the format used by glab CLI v1.66.0 and later.
