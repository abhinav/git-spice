### Added
- log: Add `spice.log.crFormat = ("id" | "url")` configuration to change how CRs are listed in the log output. The default is "id".
- GitLab: Allow changing the API URL with the `spice.forge.gitlab.apiUrl` configuration option or the `GITLAB_API_URL` environment variable.
- log: Add `spice.log.pushStatusFormat = (true | false | aheadBehind)` to show whether a branch is out-of-sync with its remote, and optionally, by how many commits. Defaults to `true`.
- repo sync: Update the trunk branch even if it's checked out in another worktree.
- commit {create, amend}: Add --allow-empty flag to allow commits without any changes.
### Changed
- log: Fetch branch information in parallel to speed up the operation.
