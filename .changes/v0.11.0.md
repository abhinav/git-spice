## <a name="v0.11.0">v0.11.0</a> - 2025-02-24
### Added
- Add 'branch squash' command to squash commits in a branch into a single commit and restack upstack branches.
- Add 'spice.branchPrompt.sort' configuration option to control the sort order of branches in the branch selection prompt used by 'branch checkout', 'branch onto', 'branch delete', and others.
- branch rename: Provide shell completions for the current branch.
### Changed
- Homebrew tap: Install shell completions.
- upstack onto: When prompting for a new base, do not allow selecting branches that are being moved as the operation will always be rejected to keep the graph acyclic.
### Fixed
- branch onto: Fix infinite rebase conflict handling loop that occurred when a branch is moved onto another branch that is upstack from the original base, and the operation encounters a rebase conflict.
- Fix debug logs using incorrect prefix for Git command output logs.
