## v0.1.0-beta4 - 2024-06-10
### Added
- repo sync: Detect PRs for local branches created and merged externally.
- Add 'log short' command (alias 'ls') to print the current stack. Use with `--all` to print all tracked branches.
### Changed
- (*Breaking*) Rename `completion` to `shell completion`. Other shell helpers are expected in the future.
- branch submit: Delay fetching PR templates until necessary. This should result in an apparent speed-up in the submission prompt.
- branch submit: Make fewer requests to GitHub for PR templates by caching them locally.
### Fixed
- branch delete: When prompting for branch selection, select current branch by default.
- {branch, upstack} onto: When prompting for a new base, default to current base.
- Fix bug in state management attempting to write files with empty names to state.
- shell completion: Command aliases can now be completed.
