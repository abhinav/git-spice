## <a name="v0.10.0">v0.10.0</a> - 2025-01-02
### Added
- commit create: Added a --fixup flag to allow adding a fixup commit.
- rebase continue: Add `--[no-]edit` flag to skip opening an editor when continuing a rebase, or opt into it if the new `spice.rebaseContinue.edit` configuration is `true`.
- Add --no-verify flag to bypass pre-commit and commit-msg hooks to commands that create new commits.
- submit: Include merged changes in navigation comments when restacking and resubmitting changes based on them.
- state: Track version of the state store layout in use. This should be a no-op for users, but it guards against corruption in case of future changes to the layout.
- submit: New `--update-only` flag tells submit commands to update open CRs but not create new ones. Branches that would create new CRs are igonred.
### Changed
- commit amend: Deprecate '-n' form of '--no-edit'. This will be removed in a future version.
- branch delete: If multiple branches are provided, they will be deleted in a more predictable order.
### Fixed
- Reduce repeated work between git-spice commands that invoke each other.
