after being in a private beta for several months.

### Changed
- all: Adjust terminology in messaging to refer to Change Requests consistently.
### Removed
- As promised in release notes for v0.1.0-beta5, drop support for old storage format for branch metadata.
### Fixed
- branch split: Fix panicking prompt when there are only two commits in the branch.
- branch submit: Fix --draft/--no-draft API failures for existing PRs.
- branch submit: Fix inability to submit if a directory name in root matches the branch name.
- branch delete: Focus on current branch by default even if it's not tracked.
- {upstack, downstack, stack} submit: Drop a few redundant calls to GitHub API.
