## <a name="v0.6.0">v0.6.0</a> - 2024-09-17
### Added
- Windows support.
### Changed
- submit: If a CR for a branch is closed or merged, and the branch is submitted again, git-spice will now create a new CR for that branch instead of failing to update the existing CR.
- repo sync: Reduce the number of network requests made to check status of submitted branches.
- repo sync: Gracefully degrade for unsupported Git hosting services by looking for merged branches locally instead of attempting to make API requests and failing. This only works for merge commits and fast-forwards, but it makes it easier to use git-spice with non-GitHub remotes.
### Fixed
- branch submit: Present template list in consistent order.
- branch create: Fix bug where aborting a commit would leave the repository in a detached HEAD state.
- repo sync: Don't warn about missing remote tracking branch if it was already deleted by a 'git fetch --prune' or similar operation.
- repo sync: Delete the correct tracking branch for renamed branches.
