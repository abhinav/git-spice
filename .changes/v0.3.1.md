### Fixed
- branch submit: Fail if Git editor is explicitly unset and there's no fallback.
- branch create: Ensure auto-generated branch names are unique.
- branch create: Don't lose data if the branch cannot be created for any reason.
- Fix messages instructing use of 'gs branch restack' to use correct arguments.
