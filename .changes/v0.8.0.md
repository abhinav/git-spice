## <a name="v0.8.0">v0.8.0</a> - 2024-11-09
### Added
- {trunk, branch checkout}: Add -n/--dry-run flag to print the target branch.
- {up, down, top, bottom, branch checkout}: Add --detach flag to detach HEAD after checking out the target branch.
- submit: Add -w/--web flag to open a browser with the submitted CR, and a `spice.submit.web` configuration option to allow making this the default.
- submit: Add `spice.submit.listTemplatesTimeout` configuration option to change the timeout for template lookup operations.
### Changed
- GitHub: API errors will now include error codes to more easily root-cause issues.
- branch split: If the branch being split has been submitted, prompt to associate the CR with one of the branches.
- submit: If a branch has already been pushed to the remote repository with `git push -u`, use that branch name when creating a CR.
- submit: If a branch name is already taken in the remote, generate a unique name for the remote branch that is used to submit the CR.
- submit: When matching externally submitted CRs to a branch, reject matches where the names are equal but their HEADs are not.
- submit: If CR template lookup from the forge times out, present the outdated templates to the user instead of presenting none.
### Fixed
- submit: Fix incorrect branch name used when a base branch of a submitted branch is renamed.
