## <a name="v0.1.0-beta2">v0.1.0-beta2</a> - 2024-06-01
### Added
- branch rename: Support renaming another branch by name with the `branch rename <old> <new>` form of the command.
### Changed
- (*Breaking*) Change shorthand for 'branch delete' to 'bd'.
- (*Breaking*) Change shorthand for 'branch rename' to 'brn'.
- rebase continue: Don't run continuations if a rebase wasn't in progress. This avoids unexpected behavior from lefotver state.
- branch checkout: Prompt for picking a branch only shows tracked branches by default. Use -u/--untracked to also see untracked branches.
- branch submit: Auto-detect PRs created outside git-spice, e.g. using the GitHub UI.
### Fixed
- repo sync: Fix failure if the worktree has uncommitted changes.
- branch delete: Don't fail if the repository is in detached HEAD state.
- branch delete: Fix repository left on the wrong branch if upstacks were restacked.
- GitHub URL detection now respects non-standard URLs like GHES set via `$GITHUB_URL`.
