## <a name="v0.15.0">v0.15.0</a> - 2025-06-23
### Added
- log short: Add `spice.logShort.crFormat` configuration option. This takes precedence over `spice.log.crFormat` for `gs log short`/`gs ls`.
- log long: Add `spice.logLong.crFormat` configuration option. This takes precedence over `spice.log.crFormat` for `gs log long`/`gs ll`.
- submit: Add --no-verify flag to bypass pre-push hooks.
### Changed
- repo sync: If a CR is closed without being merged, sync will now offer to delete their branches as well.
- branch create: Reject untracked base branches sooner in the process. This prevents unnecessary work, such as writing a commit message only to have the operation fail later.
- commit amend: Confirm user intent when called from the trunk branch, providing an option to create a new branch instead. This prevents accidental changes to the trunk branch.
- commit amend: Confirm user intent when called during a rebase operation with unresolved conflicts. This prevents accidental amendments that could complicate the rebase process.
### Fixed
- branch submit: If a GitHub PR cannot be submitted because the base branch hasn't been pushed, present a more friendly error message.
- GitLab: CLI authentication now recognizes the new token format (`glab-XXXX`).
- Rebase operations now detect conflicts caused by autostashed dirty changes to prevent corrupted state.
