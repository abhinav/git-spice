## <a name="v0.5.0">v0.5.0</a> - 2024-08-25

### Added
- submit: Add `spice.submit.publish` configuration to allow making `--no-publish` the default. Use this to work with unsupported Git hosting services.
- branch checkout: Add `spice.branchCheckout.showUntracked` configuration to always show untracked branches in checkout prompt.
- branch create: Add `--[no-]commit` flag and accompanying `spice.branchCreate.commit` configuration to create stacked branches without committing changes.
- submit: When importing existing CRs, also detect existing stack navigation comments and update them instead of posting duplicates. This will only work for comments posted git-spice v0.5 or newer.
### Fixed
- submit: When submitting with `--no-publish`, don't fail if the repository is hosted in an unsupported Git hosting services.
- {branch, upstack} onto: Always rebase commits after the operation--even if the branch's base already matches the target. This better matches user expectations when the branch and base diverge.
