## <a name="v0.5.0">v0.5.0</a> - 2024-08-25
### Added
- branch checkout: Add 'spice.branchCheckout.showUntracked' configuration to always show untracked branches in checkout prompt.
- branch create: Add `--[no-]commit` flag and accompayning `spice.branchCreate.commit` configuration to create stacked branches without committing changes.
- {branch, downstack, upstack, stack} submit: Support changing the default for --no-publish with the 'spice.submit.publish' configuration. If the configuration is set to false, use the --publish flag to opt-in to publishing.
- submit: When importing existing CRs, git-spice will also detect existing stack navigation comments and update them instead of posting duplicates. This will work only for comments posted by this version or newer.
### Changed
- {branch, upstack} onto: Rebase commits even if the branch's base matches the target. This better matches expectations when the branch falls behind the target.
### Fixed
- {branch, stack, upstack, downstack} submit: When submitting with --no-publish, allow pushing to repositories managed by unsupported forges.
