## <a name="v0.20.0">v0.20.0</a> - 2025-11-03
### Added
- commit: Add '--signoff' flag to add Signed-off-by trailer to commit messages. Enable for all commits with the 'spice.commit.signoff' configuration option.
- branch create: Add 'spice.branchCreate.generatedBranchNameLimit' configuration option to customize the length of branch names generated from commit titles.
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.navigationComment.downstack' configuration option to control whether merged CRs appear in stack navigation comments.

### Changed
- all: --help messages now include configuration options for each command.
- submit: CR creation title prompt now allows choosing from the titles of all available commits instead of always using the first. Use up/down arrow keys to navigate.
- submit: The prompt to confirm submission of empty branches now also considers branches with non-zero commits but no effective changes. This helps catch submission of empty commits or entirely reverted changes.

### Fixed
- repo sync: Avoid prompting to delete branches that have both merged and open externally created CRs -- assume the user wants to keep the branch.
- Fix data race in reading GraphQL responses from GitHub where buffers could be reused while response bodies were still being read.
- Fix crash when information for a branch could not be loaded from Git.
