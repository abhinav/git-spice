## <a name="v0.17.0">v0.17.0</a> - 2025-08-25
### Added
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.updateOnly' configuration option to default to --update-only for upstack, downstack, and stack submit operations.
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.template' configuration option to automatically select a template when multiple PR templates are available.
- repo sync: Add 'spice.repoSync.closedChanges' configuration option to control how git-spice handles closed change requests.
- branch checkout: Allow checking out remote branches by name. This will create a local branch and allow git-spice to start tracking it.
### Changed
- branch checkout: With --detach, prompt now allows selecting any branch, including those checked out in other worktrees.
### Fixed
- submit: If a pre-push hook fails, surface messages printed to stdout in the error.
- restack: Fix issue where restack operations would leave the target branch checked out instead of the previously checked out branch, even when no restack operations were performed.
