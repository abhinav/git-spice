## <a name="v0.14.0">v0.14.0</a> - 2025-05-28
### Added
- branch checkout: Add 'spice.branchCheckout.trackUntrackedPrompt' configuration option to disable prompting to track untracked branches upon checkout.
- branch create: Add 'spice.branchCreate.prefix' configuration option to always add a configured prefix to new branches.
- Add more debug-level logging across the application to help diagnose issues.
- Support CTRL+j/k to navigate selection UIs that accept text input like branch selection.
### Changed
- Log output is now styled differently for better readability.
### Fixed
- branch split: Fix debug logs interrupting the branch name prompt.
- branch track: Fix incorrectly reporting an error when a branch needs to be restacked.
- If a remote branch reference (e.g. origin/feature) is deleted after pushing to it with gs, we will no longer hold onto the stale reference.
  This better handles cases where the local and remote branches are both intended to be renamed.
