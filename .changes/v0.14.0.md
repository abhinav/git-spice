### Added
- branch checkout: Add spice.branchCheckout.trackUntrackedPrompt configuration option to disable prompting to track untracked branches upon checkout.
- Add 'spice.branchCreate.prefix' configuration option to always add a configured prefix to new branches.

- Add more debug-level logging across the application to help diagnose issues.
- Support CTRL+J/K to navigate selection UIs that accept text input, i.e branch selection.
### Changed
- Log output is now styled differently for better readability.
### Fixed
- If a remote branch reference (e.g. origin/feature) is deleted after pushing to it with git-spice, we will no longer hold onto the stale reference.
- branch split: Fix debug logs interrupting the branch name prompt.
- branch track: Fix incorrectly reporting an error when a branch needs to be restacked.
