Usage: gs branch (b) track (tr) [<branch>] [flags]

Track a branch

A branch must be tracked to be able to run gs operations on it. Use 'gs branch
create' to automatically track new branches.

The base is guessed by comparing against other tracked branches. Use --base to
specify a base explicitly.

Use 'gs downstack track' from the topmost branch to track a manully created
stack of branches at once.

Arguments:
  [<branch>]    Name of the branch to track

Flags:
  -b, --base=BRANCH    Base branch this merges into

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
