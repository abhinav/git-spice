Usage: gs commit (c) pick (p) [<commit>] [flags]

Cherry-pick a commit

Apply the changes introduced by a commit to the current branch and restack the
upstack branches.

If a commit is not specified, a prompt will allow picking from commits of
upstack branches of the current branch. Use the --from option to pick a commit
from a different branch or its upstack.

If it's not possible to cherry-pick the requested commit without causing a
conflict, the command will fail. If the requested commit is a merge commit,
the command will fail.

This command requires at least Git 2.45.

Arguments:
  [<commit>]    Commit to cherry-pick

Flags:
  --from=NAME    Branch whose upstack commits will be considered.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
