Usage: gs commit (c) fixup (f) [<commit>] [flags]

Fixup a commit below the current commit

Apply staged uncommited changes to another commit down the stack, and restack
the rest of the stack on top of it.

If a commit is not specified, a prompt is shown to select one. If the commit is
specified, it must be reachable from the current commit, (i.e. it must be down
the stack).

If it's not possible to apply the staged changes to the commit without causing a
conflict, the command will fail.

This command requires at least Git 2.45.

Arguments:
  [<commit>]    The commit to fixup. Must be reachable from the HEAD commit.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
