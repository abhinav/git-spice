Usage: gs upstack (us) delete (d) [flags]

Delete all branches above the current branch

Deletes all branches above the current branch in the stack, not including the
current branch. The current branch remains unchanged.

This is a convenient way to clean up abandoned or completed parts of a feature
stack.

As this is a destructive operation, you must use the --force flag to confirm
deletion.

Flags:
  --force    Force deletion of the branches

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
