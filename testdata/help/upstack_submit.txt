Usage: gs upstack (us) submit (s) [flags]

Submit a branch and those above it

Change Requests are created or updated for the current branch and all branches
upstack from it. If the base of the current branch is not trunk, it must have
already been submitted by a prior command. Use --branch to start at a different
branch.

Use --dry-run to print what would be submitted without submitting it.

For new Change Requests, a prompt will allow filling metadata. Use --fill to
populate title and body from the commit messages. The --[no-]draft flag marks
the CR as draft or not. Use the 'spice.submit.draft' configuration option to
mark new CRs as drafts (or not) by default, skipping the prompt.

For updating Change Requests, use --[no-]draft to change its draft status.
Without the flag, the draft status is not changed.

Use --no-publish to push branches without creating CRs. This has no effect if a
branch already has an open CR.

Use --update-only to only update branches with existing CRs, and skip those that
would create new CRs.

Use --nav-comment=false to disable navigation comments in CRs, or
--nav-comment=multiple to post those comments only if there are multiple CRs in
the stack.
