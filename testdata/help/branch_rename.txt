Usage: gs branch (b) rename (rn,mv) [<old-name> [<new-name>]]

Rename a branch

The following usage modes are supported:

    # Rename <old> to <new>
    gs branch rename <old> <new>

    # Rename current branch to <new>
    gs branch rename <new>

    # Rename current branch interactively
    gs branch rename

If a branch was renamed outside of 'gs', for example with 'git branch -m',
the branch tracking information will be out of date. To fix this, untrack the
old branch name with 'gs branch untrack <old>', and track the new branch name
with 'gs branch track <new>'.

Arguments:
  [<old-name>]    Old name of the branch
  [<new-name>]    New name of the branch

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
