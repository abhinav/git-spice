Usage: gs stack (s) edit (e) [flags]

Edit the order of branches in a stack

This operation requires a linear stack: no branch can have multiple branches
above it.

An editor opens with a list of branches in the current stack in-order, with the
topmost branch at the top of the file, and the branch closest to the trunk at
the bottom.

Modifications to the list will be reflected in the stack when the editor is
closed. If the file is cleared, no changes will be made. Branches that are
deleted from the list will be ignored.

Flags:
  --editor=STRING    Editor to use for editing the downstack. Defaults to Git's
                     default editor.
  --branch=NAME      Branch whose stack we're editing. Defaults to current
                     branch.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
