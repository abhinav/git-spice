Usage: gs branch (b) untrack (untr) [<branch>]

Forget a tracked branch

The current branch is deleted from git-spice's data store but not deleted from
the repository. Branches upstack from it are not affected, and will use the next
branch downstack as their new base.

Provide a branch name as an argument to target a different branch.

Arguments:
  [<branch>]    Name of the branch to untrack. Defaults to current.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
