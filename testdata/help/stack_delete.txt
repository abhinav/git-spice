Usage: gs stack (s) delete (d) [flags]

Delete all branches in a stack

Deletes all branches in the current branch's stack. This includes both upstack
and downstack branches.

The deleted branches and their commits are removed from the stack. This is a
convenient way to clean up completed or abandoned feature stacks.

As this is a destructive operation, you must use the --force flag to confirm
deletion.

Flags:
  --force    Force deletion of the branches

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
