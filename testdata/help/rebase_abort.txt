Usage: gs rebase (rb) abort (a)

Abort an operation

Cancels an ongoing git-spice operation that was interrupted by a git rebase.
For example, if 'gs upstack restack' encounters a conflict, cancel the operation
with 'gs rebase abort' (or its shorthand 'gs rba'), going back to the state
before the rebase.

The command can be used in place of 'git rebase --abort' even if a git-spice
operation is not currently in progress.

  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
