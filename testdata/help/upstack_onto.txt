Usage: gs upstack (us) onto (o) [<onto>] [flags]

Move a branch onto another branch

The current branch and its upstack will move onto the new base.

A prompt will allow selecting the new base for the branch. Provide an argument
to skip the prompt. Use the --branch flag to target a different branch for the
move.

For example, given the following stack with B checked out, 'gs upstack onto
main' will have the following effect:

           gs upstack onto main

        â”Œâ”€â”€ C                 â”Œâ”€â”€ C
      â”Œâ”€â”´ B â—€               â”Œâ”€â”´ B â—€
    â”Œâ”€â”´ A                   â”œâ”€â”€ A
    trunk                   trunk

Use 'gs branch onto' to leave the branch's upstack alone.
