Usage: gs repo (r) init (i) [flags]

Initialize a repository

A trunk branch is required. This is the branch that changes will be merged into.
A prompt will ask for one if not provided with --trunk.

Most branch stacking operations are local and do not require a network
connection. For operations that push or pull commits, a remote is required.
A prompt will ask for one during initialization if not provided with --remote.

Re-run the command on an already initialized repository to change the trunk or
remote. If the trunk branch is changed on re-initialization, existing branches
stacked on the old trunk will be updated to point to the new trunk.

Re-run with --reset to discard all stored information and untrack all branches.

Flags:
  --trunk=BRANCH    Name of the trunk branch
  --remote=NAME     Name of the remote to push changes to
  --reset           Forget all information about the repository

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
