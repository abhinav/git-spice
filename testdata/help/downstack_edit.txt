Usage: gs downstack (ds) edit (e) [flags]

Edit the order of branches below a branch

An editor opens with a list of branches in-order, starting from the current
branch until trunk. The current branch is at the top of the list. Use --branch
to start at a different branch.

Modifications to the list will be reflected in the stack when the editor is
closed, and the topmost branch will be checked out. If the file is cleared, no
changes will be made. Branches that are deleted from the list will be ignored.
Branches that are upstack of the current branch will not be modified.

Flags:
  --editor=STRING    Editor to use for editing the downstack. Defaults to Git's
                     default editor.
  --branch=NAME      Branch to edit from. Defaults to current branch.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
