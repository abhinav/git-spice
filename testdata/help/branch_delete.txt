Usage: gs branch (b) delete (d,rm) [<branches> ...] [flags]

Delete branches

The deleted branches and their commits are removed from the stack. Branches
above the deleted branches are first rebased onto the next branches available
downstack, or onto trunk if there are no branches available below.

Without any arguments, a prompt will allow selecting the branch to delete.

By default, if the branch to be deleted has unmerged changes, the deletion will
be aborted. Use --force to delete the branch regardless of unmerged changes.

Arguments:
  [<branches> ...]    Names of the branches to delete

Flags:
  --force    Force deletion of the branch

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information

Configuration (ðŸ”§):
  spice.branchPrompt.sort    Sort branches by the given field. Common values
                             include 'refname', 'commiterdate', etc. Defaults to
                             branch name.
