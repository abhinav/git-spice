Usage: gs commit (c) split (sp) [<commit>] [flags]

Split the current commit

Interactively select hunks from a commit to split into multiple new commits
below it. Branches upstack are restacked as needed.

The commit defaults to HEAD. If a different commit is specified, an interactive
rebase will be used to split it.

The split process loops until all changes are committed. Press 'q' during hunk
selection to stop splitting and commit any remaining changes together.

Arguments:
  [<commit>]    Commit to split (default: HEAD).

Flags:
  -m, --message=MSG    Commit message for first split.
      --no-verify      Bypass pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
