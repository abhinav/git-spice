Usage: gs auth login [flags]

Log in to a service

A prompt will allow selecting between available authentication methods.
Available methods include:

- OAuth: Web-based authentication flow - GitHub App (GitHub only):
Authenticate using a GitHub App installation - Personal Access Token: Directly
provide a personal access token - CLI: Use the GitHub or GitLab CLI tool for
authentication (if installed)

The differences between them are explained in the prompt.

The authentication token is stored in a system-provided secure storage if
available. Use 'gs auth logout' to log out and delete the token from storage.

Fails if already logged in. Use --refresh to force a refresh of the
authentication token or change the authentication method.
