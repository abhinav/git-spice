Usage: gs branch (b) onto (on) [<onto>] [flags]

Move a branch onto another branch

Commits of the current branch are transplanted onto another branch while leaving
the rest of the stack intact. That is, branches above the current branch are
first rebased onto its original base, and then the current branch is moved onto
the new base.

A prompt will allow selecting the new base for the branch. Provide an argument
to skip the prompt. Use the --branch flag to target a different branch for the
move.

For example, given the following stack with B checked out, running 'gs branch
onto main' will move B onto main and leave C on top of A.

           gs branch onto main

        â”Œâ”€â”€ C               â”Œâ”€â”€ B â—€
      â”Œâ”€â”´ B â—€               â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€ C
    â”Œâ”€â”´ A                   â”œâ”€â”´ A
    trunk                   trunk

Use 'gs upstack onto' to also move the upstack branches.
