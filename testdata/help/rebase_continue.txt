Usage: gs rebase (rb) continue (c) [flags]

Continue an interrupted operation

Continues an ongoing git-spice operation interrupted by a git rebase after
all conflicts have been resolved. For example, if 'gs upstack restack' gets
interrupted because a conflict arises during the rebase, you can resolve the
conflict and run 'gs rebase continue' (or its shorthand 'gs rbc') to continue
the operation.

The command can be used in place of 'git rebase --continue' even if a git-spice
operation is not currently in progress.

Use the --no-edit flag to continue without opening an editor. Make --no-edit
the default by setting 'spice.rebaseContinue.edit' to false and use --edit to
override it.

Flags:
  --[no-]edit    Whether to open an editor to edit the commit message.
                 (ðŸ”§ spice.rebaseContinue.edit)

Global Flags:
  -h, --help           Show help for the command
      --version        Print version information and quit
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output ($GIT_SPICE_VERBOSE)
  -C, --dir=DIR        Change to DIR before doing anything
      --[no-]prompt    Whether to prompt for missing information
