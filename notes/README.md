# Architecture Decision Records

This is an experiment in documenting design decision for the project from day
one. All features and functionality will be detailed in documents inside this
directory.

The following is a list of all decisions in chronological order:

* [1. Record architecture decisions](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)
* [2. Write a PR stacking tool](0002-write-a-pr-stacking-tool.md)
* [3. Use ff to parse flags](0003-use-ff-to-parse-flags.md)
* [4. Commit metadata storage](0004-commit-metadata-storage.md)
* [5. Submit commit range](0005-submit-commit-range.md)
