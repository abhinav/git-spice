= Commit range for the submit command
2023-06-25
:status: published

== Context

The `submit` command needs to know what range of commits
it should submitâ€“create or update PRs for.
We need to define the default range for it,
as well as what customizations it allows.

== Decision

Initially, we will use the `@{upstream}` shorthand provided by Git
to get the upstream.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
git rev-list HEAD --not @{upstream}
----

== Consequences

This will only work for branches that have an upstream configured.
For branches that do not have an upstream configured,
users will have to do:

[source,bash]
----
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
----

This limitation can be addressed in the future.
