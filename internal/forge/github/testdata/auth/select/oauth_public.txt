Select an authentication method:
▶ OAuth
  Authorize git-spice to act on your behalf from this device only.
  git-spice will get access to all repositories: public and private.
  For private repositories, you will need to request installation from a
  repository owner.

  OAuth: Public repositories only
  Authorize git-spice to act on your behalf from this device only.
  git-spice will only get access to public repositories.

  GitHub App
  Authorize git-spice to act on your behalf from this device only.
  git-spice will only get access to repositories where the git-spice GitHub
  App is installed explicitly.
  Use https://github.com/apps/git-spice to install the App on repositories.
  For private repositories, you will need to request installation from a
  repository owner.

  Personal Access Token
  Enter a classic or fine-grained Personal Access Token generated from
  https://github.com/settings/tokens.
  Classic tokens need at least one of the following scopes: repo or
  public_repo.
  Fine-grained tokens need read/write access to Repository Contents and Pull
  requests.
  You can use this method if you do not have the ability to install a GitHub
  or OAuth App on your repositories.

  GitHub CLI
  Re-use an existing GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com) session.
  You must be logged into gh with 'gh auth login' for this to work.
  You can use this if you're just experimenting and don't want to set up a
  token yet.
