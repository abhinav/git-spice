# Large Language Models

## Development transparency

The maintainers of git-spice often use Large Language Models (LLMs)
for implementation and debugging assistance during development.
All LLM-generated output goes through human review,
and the project maintains a high bar for code quality and testing.

If LLM usage in development is a concern for you,
all versions up to and including <!-- gs:version v0.15.0 -->
are free of LLM-generated code.
These versions are quite featureful.

## LLM-friendly documentation

If you want to feed git-spice documentation to an LLM,
this website provides the following files per
[llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) guidelines:

- [llms.txt](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/llms.txt)
- [llms-full.txt](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/llms-full.txt)
