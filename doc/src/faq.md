# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is stacking?

Stacking refers to the practice of creating interdependent branches
on top of each other.
Each branch in the stack builds on top of the previous one.
For example, you might have a branch `feature-a` that adds a new feature,
and a branch `feature-b` that builds on top of `feature-a`.

Stacking your changes lets you:

- **Unblock yourself**:
  While one branch is under review, you can start working on the next one.
- **Be kinder to your team**:
  By keeping changes small and focused, you make it easier for your team
  to review, test, and understand your work.
  A 100 line PR gets a more meaningful review than a 1000 line PR.

git-spice helps you manage your stack of branches,
keeping them up-to-date and in sync with each other.
