## <a name="v0.18.0">v0.18.0</a> - 2025-09-25

A couple highlights from this release:

- git-spice now supports a new experimental command: `gs commit fixup`.
  It is able to amend any commit in the current branch or any downstack branch.
  Think `git commit --amend`, but fully stack-aware.

  ![demo of gs commit fixup](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/abhinav/git-spice/refs/heads/main/doc/tapes/20250924-commit-fixup.gif)

  As the feature is experimental, you must opt into it to access it by running:

  ```bash
  git config spice.experiment.commitFixup true  # enable for this repository
  git config --global spice.experiment.commitFixup true    # enable globally
  ```

  If you use it, please feedback and issues about the experimental feature at
  https://github.com/abhinav/git-spice/discussions/867.

- We've addressed a long-standing limitation of `gs branch split`:
  it was previously unable to move the branch do an intermediate commit.
  Suppose if the branch being split--say 'penguin'--has two commits:
  (a) Invent penguins, and (b) Refactor pangolin, and the branch head points to commit (b).
  Previously, `gs branch split` would not let you use the name 'penguin' for commit (a),
  as it was already attached to commit (b).

  This limitation has now been resolved: you can now move 'penguin' down to commit (a),
  and create a new branch 'pangolin' for commit (b).

  ![demo of gs branch split re-using a branch name](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/abhinav/git-spice/refs/heads/main/doc/tapes/20250924-branch-split-reuse-name.gif)

- `gs log long` (`gs ll`) and `gs log short` (`gs ls`) both now support a `--json` flag.
  When used, they print all available information as JSON to stdout.
  You can consume this output with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.org) to implement custom automations using information from git-spice.

### Added
- branch checkout/delete/onto: Include CR numbers in prompt visualization, and allow searching and filtering by CR identifiers.
- Experimental 'gs branch fixup' command that acts like 'git commit --amend' for any downstack commit. It will commit staged changes to a downstack commit, and automatically rebase the rest of the stack on top of it. See <https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/cli/experiments> for instructions on enabling this experimental feature.
- log {long, short}: Add --json flag. This prints information about tracked branches to stdout as a stream of JSON objects.
- log {long, short}: Add -S/--cr-status flag to request the statuses of change requests that have been published.
### Changed
- branch split: Allow reusing original branch name for intermediate commits during split.
- Homebrew Tap now publishes the package as a Cask. If you previously installed with `brew install abhinav/tap/git-spice`, switch to the cask with `brew install --cask abhinav/tap/git-spice`. You can ignore this if you installed from homebrew-core (`brew install git-spice`).
- gitlab: Submit Merge Requests with `remove_source_branch=true`. This will delete the source branch when the MR is merged. Opt out of this behavior with the `spice.forge.gitlab.removeSourceBranch` option.
### Removed
- commit amend: Delete -n flag that was deprecated in favor of --no-edit in v0.10.0 (2025-01-02). If you need a short way to use this flag, try defining a custom shorthand.
### Fixed
- repo restack: Autostash dirty changes in the working tree before the operation. Previously, the changes wouldn't be stashed until checking out the first branch, an operation which might fail because of other conflicts.

## <a name="v0.17.1">v0.17.1</a> - 2025-09-13
### Fixed
- log: When used without `--all`, query only requested branches internally. This was wasted work and slowed the command down in repositories with many branches.
- log: List all tracked branches when run from an untracked branch or detached HEAD. Previously, this behavior was undefined.
- Fix incorrect paths being logged when autostashed changes fail to reapply after a rebase operation.

## <a name="v0.17.0">v0.17.0</a> - 2025-08-25
### Added
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.updateOnly' configuration option to default to --update-only for upstack, downstack, and stack submit operations.
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.template' configuration option to automatically select a template when multiple PR templates are available.
- repo sync: Add 'spice.repoSync.closedChanges' configuration option to control how git-spice handles closed change requests.
- branch checkout: Allow checking out remote branches by name. This will create a local branch and allow git-spice to start tracking it.
### Changed
- branch checkout: With --detach, prompt now allows selecting any branch, including those checked out in other worktrees.
### Fixed
- submit: If a pre-push hook fails, surface messages printed to stdout in the error.
- restack: Fix issue where restack operations would leave the target branch checked out instead of the previously checked out branch, even when no restack operations were performed.

## <a name="v0.16.1">v0.16.1</a> - 2025-08-08
### Fixed
- Fix panic when the 'spice.submit.navigationCommentSync' configuration option is set to 'downstack', and one of the downstacks has already been merged.

## <a name="v0.16.0">v0.16.0</a> - 2025-08-02

This release contains a number of improvements.
Full list available below, but a couple highlights:

- Custom shorthands now support shelling out to external commands by prefixing them with `!`--similarly to Git aliases.
- A number of fixes have been made to make git-spice commands play nicer with [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).
- `submit` commands now support a `--label` flag and configuration option that adds labels to GitHub Pull Requests and GitLab Merge Requests upon submission.
- `submit` commands can now be configured to open a web browser _only_ for newly created CRs. Use `git config --global spice.submit.web create` to opt into this behavior.

### Added
- Add support for custom shorthands to invoke external shell commands.
- submit: Add -l/--label flag and accompanying 'spice.submit.label' configuration option to add labels to created/updated CRs.
- stack delete: New command to delete all branches in the current branch's stack.
- upstack delete: New command to delete all branches upstack from the current branch, not including the current branch.
- repo restack: New command to restack all tracked branches.
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.draft' configuration option to control the default value of --draft/--no-draft for new CRs.
- checkout: Add 'spice.checkout.verbose' configuration option to report the branch name checked out. This works for `up`, `down`, `top`, and `bottom` commands too.
- submit: Add 'spice.submit.navigationCommentSync' configuration option to control which branches' navigation comments are updated when a change is submitted.
- stack restack: Add --branch option to restack the stack of a different branch.
- branch squash: Add --branch option to specify the branch being targeted.
- branch squash: Add --no-edit flag to use generated commit message without opening an editor.

### Changed
- submit: Support a value of 'created' for the --web flag and the 'spice.submit.web' configuration option. This will result in only new CRs being opened in a browser.
- branch fold: Confirm user intent when called from a branch based directly on the trunk branch. This prevents accidentally folding changes into trunk.
- repo init: Warn when trunk is behind upstream at initialization time. This prevents issues caused by trying to rebase newer feature branches on top of a severely old trunk branch.
- branch squash: Use a commit message template similar to Git. Information from git-spice is commented out and commit messages are presented in oldest-to-newest order.

### Fixed
- repo init: Validate that the trunk branch is a local branch.
- repo sync: Don't fail if a merged branch is checked out in another worktree. Log a message and skip it.
- branch delete: Don't fail if the branch to check out after deletion is checked out in another worktree. Log a message and detach HEAD.
- restack: If a branch planned to be restacked is checked out in another worktree, don't attempt to restack it or its upstacks.
- log long: Fix incorrect list of commits listed in the log following a manual rebase operation.
- branch squash: Fix no-op commit left behind in some scenarios when 'branch squash' is run after a manual rebase.
- Fix concurrent updates to git-spice's state causing "cannot lock ref" warnings.
- up: Don't re-load state repeatedly when going up >1 branches. This is >8x faster in degenerate cases.
- stack restack: Don't reload state information to determine upstack/downstack branches.

## <a name="v0.15.2">v0.15.2</a> - 2025-07-07
### Fixed
- submit: Pre-push hooks should run in the same worktree as the submit command.

## <a name="v0.15.1">v0.15.1</a> - 2025-06-25
### Fixed
- Fix several operations using the incorrect Git worktree when invoked from the non-primary worktree.

## <a name="v0.15.0">v0.15.0</a> - 2025-06-23
### Added
- log short: Add `spice.logShort.crFormat` configuration option. This takes precedence over `spice.log.crFormat` for `gs log short`/`gs ls`.
- log long: Add `spice.logLong.crFormat` configuration option. This takes precedence over `spice.log.crFormat` for `gs log long`/`gs ll`.
- submit: Add --no-verify flag to bypass pre-push hooks.
### Changed
- repo sync: If a CR is closed without being merged, sync will now offer to delete their branches as well.
- branch create: Reject untracked base branches sooner in the process. This prevents unnecessary work, such as writing a commit message only to have the operation fail later.
- commit amend: Confirm user intent when called from the trunk branch, providing an option to create a new branch instead. This prevents accidental changes to the trunk branch.
- commit amend: Confirm user intent when called during a rebase operation with unresolved conflicts. This prevents accidental amendments that could complicate the rebase process.
### Fixed
- branch submit: If a GitHub PR cannot be submitted because the base branch hasn't been pushed, present a more friendly error message.
- GitLab: CLI authentication now recognizes the new token format (`glab-XXXX`).
- Rebase operations now detect conflicts caused by autostashed dirty changes to prevent corrupted state.

## <a name="v0.14.1">v0.14.1</a> - 2025-05-30
### Fixed
- Fix panic when using shell tab completion for a branch name.

## <a name="v0.14.0">v0.14.0</a> - 2025-05-28
### Added
- branch checkout: Add 'spice.branchCheckout.trackUntrackedPrompt' configuration option to disable prompting to track untracked branches upon checkout.
- branch create: Add 'spice.branchCreate.prefix' configuration option to always add a configured prefix to new branches.
- Add more debug-level logging across the application to help diagnose issues.
- Support CTRL+j/k to navigate selection UIs that accept text input like branch selection.
### Changed
- Log output is now styled differently for better readability.
### Fixed
- branch split: Fix debug logs interrupting the branch name prompt.
- branch track: Fix incorrectly reporting an error when a branch needs to be restacked.
- If a remote branch reference (e.g. origin/feature) is deleted after pushing to it with gs, we will no longer hold onto the stale reference.
  This better handles cases where the local and remote branches are both intended to be renamed.

## <a name="v0.13.0">v0.13.0</a> - 2025-04-26
### Added
- log: Add `spice.log.crFormat = ("id" | "url")` configuration to change how CRs are listed in the log output. The default is "id".
- GitLab: Allow changing the API URL with the `spice.forge.gitlab.apiUrl` configuration option or the `GITLAB_API_URL` environment variable.
- log: Add `spice.log.pushStatusFormat = (true | false | aheadBehind)` to show whether a branch is out-of-sync with its remote, and optionally, by how many commits. Defaults to `true`.
- repo sync: Update the trunk branch even if it's checked out in another worktree.
- commit {create, amend}: Add --allow-empty flag to allow commits without any changes.
### Changed
- log: Fetch branch information in parallel to speed up the operation.

## <a name="v0.12.0">v0.12.0</a> - 2025-03-06
### Added
- Add 'version' command as alternative to '--version' flag.
### Fixed
- gitlab: Fix rejection of `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication.

## <a name="v0.11.0">v0.11.0</a> - 2025-02-24
### Added
- Add 'branch squash' command to squash commits in a branch into a single commit and restack upstack branches.
- Add 'spice.branchPrompt.sort' configuration option to control the sort order of branches in the branch selection prompt used by 'branch checkout', 'branch onto', 'branch delete', and others.
- branch rename: Provide shell completions for the current branch.
### Changed
- Homebrew tap: Install shell completions.
- upstack onto: When prompting for a new base, do not allow selecting branches that are being moved as the operation will always be rejected to keep the graph acyclic.
### Fixed
- branch onto: Fix infinite rebase conflict handling loop that occurred when a branch is moved onto another branch that is upstack from the original base, and the operation encounters a rebase conflict.
- Fix debug logs using incorrect prefix for Git command output logs.

## <a name="v0.10.0">v0.10.0</a> - 2025-01-02

This release addresses a long-standing limitation of navigation comments:
they were limited only to open CRs.
With the help of [@VenelinMartinov](https://github.com/VenelinMartinov),
git-spice will now retain history of merged downstack CRs when posting navigation comments.

### Added
- commit create: Add `--fixup` flag to create fixup commits. You can use `git rebase --interactive` or `gs branch edit` to combine these fixup commits into their targets.
- rebase continue: Add `--[no-]edit` flag to specify whether an editor should open to change the commit message. Defaults to the value of the `spice.rebaseContinue.edit` configuration option if set, or true if not.
- Add `--no-verify` flag to bypass pre-commit and commit-msg Git hooks for commands that create new commits. This includes 'commit create', 'commit amend', 'commit split', and 'branch create'.
- state: Track version of the state store layout in use. This should be a no-op for users, but it protects against future changes to the layout.
- submit: Add `--update-only` flag to update open CRs but not create new ones. Branches that would create new CRs are ignored.
### Changed
- submit: Include merged downstack changes in navigation comments when restacking and resubmitting changes based on them.
- commit amend: Deprecate `-n` form of `--no-edit`. This will be deleted in a future version.
- branch delete: If multiple branches are provided, delete them in a more predictable order.
### Fixed
- Reduce repeated work between git-spice commands that invoke each other.

## <a name="v0.9.0">v0.9.0</a> - 2024-11-26

This release adds support for using git-spice with GitLab.
This works for both, gitlab.com and [Self-Hosted GitLab](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/setup/auth/#gitlab-self-hosted) instances.
Thanks to [@gr4cza](https://github.com/gr4cza) for implementing GitLab support.

### Added
- Add support for GitLab forge.
- repo sync: Add a --restack flag to automatically restack the current stack after syncing.

## <a name="v0.8.1">v0.8.1</a> - 2024-11-12
### Fixed
- Shell completion: Don't use an incorrect command name if the binary is renamed.

## <a name="v0.8.0">v0.8.0</a> - 2024-11-09
### Added
- {trunk, branch checkout}: Add -n/--dry-run flag to print the target branch.
- {up, down, top, bottom, branch checkout}: Add --detach flag to detach HEAD after checking out the target branch.
- submit: Add -w/--web flag to open a browser with the submitted CR, and a `spice.submit.web` configuration option to allow making this the default.
- submit: Add `spice.submit.listTemplatesTimeout` configuration option to change the timeout for template lookup operations.
### Changed
- GitHub: API errors will now include error codes to more easily root-cause issues.
- branch split: If the branch being split has been submitted, prompt to associate the CR with one of the branches.
- submit: If a branch has already been pushed to the remote repository with `git push -u`, use that branch name when creating a CR.
- submit: If a branch name is already taken in the remote, generate a unique name for the remote branch that is used to submit the CR.
- submit: When matching externally submitted CRs to a branch, reject matches where the names are equal but their HEADs are not.
- submit: If CR template lookup from the forge times out, present the outdated templates to the user instead of presenting none.
### Fixed
- submit: Fix incorrect branch name used when a base branch of a submitted branch is renamed.

## <a name="v0.7.1">v0.7.1</a> - 2024-10-26
### Fixed
- branch submit: Fix bad log statement in --dry-run mode.
- branch submit: Fix bug when importing externally created PRs, where the first comment in the PR would be hijacked as the navigation comment.

## <a name="v0.7.0">v0.7.0</a> - 2024-10-02

This release contains significant changes to internal state management to prevent corruption.
If you run into any issues, please [report them here](https://github.com/abhinav/git-spice/issues/new).

### Changed
- branch delete: Accept multiple branches for deletion.
- Branch selection widget is now smarter about prioritizing fuzzy matches.
### Fixed
- branch create: Prevent creation of tracked branches with untracked bases as this leaves the storage in a corrupted state.
- repo init: Don't leave dangling branch references when trunk is changed.
- branch create: Don't commit staged changes if git-spice is unable to save the branch to its internal storage.
- branch onto: Don't rebase the branch if changing its base would corrupt the data store.
- github: Recognize remote URLs in the form `ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/org/repo`.
- repo sync: Fix case when many branches from the same stack are merged, and order of deletion causes a restacking error or conflict.
- repo sync: Reduce the number of redundant operations performed when processing multiple merged branches.

## <a name="v0.6.0">v0.6.0</a> - 2024-09-17
### Added
- Windows support.
### Changed
- submit: If a CR for a branch is closed or merged, and the branch is submitted again, git-spice will now create a new CR for that branch instead of failing to update the existing CR.
- repo sync: Reduce the number of network requests made to check status of submitted branches.
- repo sync: Gracefully degrade for unsupported Git hosting services by looking for merged branches locally instead of attempting to make API requests and failing. This only works for merge commits and fast-forwards, but it makes it easier to use git-spice with non-GitHub remotes.
### Fixed
- branch submit: Present template list in consistent order.
- branch create: Fix bug where aborting a commit would leave the repository in a detached HEAD state.
- repo sync: Don't warn about missing remote tracking branch if it was already deleted by a 'git fetch --prune' or similar operation.
- repo sync: Delete the correct tracking branch for renamed branches.

## <a name="v0.5.2">v0.5.2</a> - 2024-08-30
### Fixed
- submit: Fix outdated PR template being used when trunk is behind its remote ref.
- github: Fix outdated PR templates being used when templates used lower-cased file names.

## <a name="v0.5.1">v0.5.1</a> - 2024-08-28
### Fixed
- Support use with older Git versions by dropping use of a v2.33-only flag.

## <a name="v0.5.0">v0.5.0</a> - 2024-08-25

### Added
- submit: Add `spice.submit.publish` configuration to allow making `--no-publish` the default. Use this to work with unsupported Git hosting services.
- branch checkout: Add `spice.branchCheckout.showUntracked` configuration to always show untracked branches in checkout prompt.
- branch create: Add `--[no-]commit` flag and accompanying `spice.branchCreate.commit` configuration to create stacked branches without committing changes.
- submit: When importing existing CRs, also detect existing stack navigation comments and update them instead of posting duplicates. This will only work for comments posted git-spice v0.5 or newer.
### Fixed
- submit: When submitting with `--no-publish`, don't fail if the repository is hosted in an unsupported Git hosting services.
- {branch, upstack} onto: Always rebase commits after the operation--even if the branch's base already matches the target. This better matches user expectations when the branch and base diverge.

## <a name="v0.4.0">v0.4.0</a> - 2024-08-09

This release adds support for configuring the behavior of git-spice
with use of the `git config` command.

### Added
- cli: Support custom shorthands with the `spice.shorthand.*` configuration option.
- submit: Support opting out or reducing navigation comment frequency with the --nav-comment flag.
  The accompanying `spice.submit.navigationComment` configuration option may also be used instead.

- GitHub Enterprise: Allow setting the GitHub URL and API URL with the
  `spice.forge.github.url` and `spice.forge.github.apiUrl` configuration options.
### Changed
- GitHub Enterprise: `GITHUB_API_URL` is now optional. If not set, we'll guess it from the GitHub URL.

## <a name="v0.3.1">v0.3.1</a> - 2024-07-30
### Fixed
- branch submit: Fail if Git editor is explicitly unset and there's no fallback.
- branch create: Ensure auto-generated branch names are unique.
- branch create: Don't lose data if the branch cannot be created for any reason.
- Fix messages instructing use of 'gs branch restack' to use correct arguments.

## <a name="v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> - 2024-07-24
### Added

### Changed
- cli: Show --help when run without arguments
### Fixed

- branch submit: Fix bug where updating an open PR would overwrite changes pushed to it by others. Use --force to overwrite these changes.
- branch submit: Use the same editor used by Git for commit messages to author the PR body.
- branch submit: Allow Git editor to be a shell command, not just an executable name.
- {downstack, stack} edit: Use Git editor to edit list of branches.

## <a name="v0.1.0">v0.1.0</a> - 2024-07-22

Announcing git-spice, a tool to stack Git branches with ease.
This is the first public release of the tool
after being in a private beta for several months.

### Removed
- (**Breaking**) git-spice no longer shells out to the GitHub CLI for authentication. Use the new 'gs auth' command to log in.

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta6">v0.1.0-beta6</a> - 2024-06-28
### Added
- Add 'stack edit' command to edit an entire stack, similarly to 'downstack edit'.
- Add 'branch split' command to split an existing branch with multiple commits into one or more new branches.
### Changed
- upstack restack: Rename --no-base to --skip-start.
- upstack restack: Target branch name is now a --branch flag.
- downstack submit: Optional positional branch argument is now --branch flag.
- downstack edit: Optional positional branch argument is now a --branch flag.
- branch fold: The optional branch name argument is now a flag.
- branch restack: The optional positional argument is now a --branch flag.
- branch submit: Optional branch positional argument is now the --branch flag.
### Fixed
- branch submit: If there's a PR template but no commit body, don't add extraneous newlines at the start of the default PR description.
- upstack restack: Fix --no-base ignored when there's only one branch.
- commit {create, amend}: Fix unintended restacking of current branch when there's only one branch in the stack.
- branch onto: Move the upstack of the target branch before the brach itself. This makes the operation better able to recover from conflicts.

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta5">v0.1.0-beta5</a> - 2024-06-17
### Added
- branch create: Add -b/--base flag to specify a different base branch for the new branch.
- branch submit: Add --no-publish to push or update a branch without publishing a pull request.
- upstack restack: Accept name of base branch as an argument. Defaults to current branch.
- upstack restack: Add --no-base flag to skip restacking the starting base branch.
- {up, down, top, bottom}: Add -n/--dry-run flag. This will print the target branch name without checking it out. Output may be piped to other commands.
- branch submit: If a repository has multiple templates, allow picking between them in the submission prompt.
- Add 'gs log long' (alias 'gs ll') to list branches and their commits.
### Changed
- shell completion: Make shell argument optional and guess shell based on environment.
- Prompts are now posted to stderr instead of stdout.
- branch delete: Prompt to force delete unmerged branches instead of just letting Git fail.

### Fixed
- Fix name for Linux AMD64 release tarball to match `uname -m` for easier fetching from scripts.
- commit {create, amend}: Don't restack the current branch on commit. Only the upstacks will be restacked.
- shell completion: Better handling of quoted strings while predicting.

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta4">v0.1.0-beta4</a> - 2024-06-10
### Added
- repo sync: Detect PRs for local branches created and merged externally.
- Add 'log short' command (alias 'ls') to print the current stack. Use with `--all` to print all tracked branches.
### Changed
- (*Breaking*) Rename `completion` to `shell completion`. Other shell helpers are expected in the future.
- branch submit: Delay fetching PR templates until necessary. This should result in an apparent speed-up in the submission prompt.
- branch submit: Make fewer requests to GitHub for PR templates by caching them locally.
### Fixed

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta3">v0.1.0-beta3</a> - 2024-06-05
### Added
- branch submit: Populate default PR message with PR template, if found.
### Changed
- branch submit: Update an existing PR's draft status only if `--draft` or `--no-draft` flags are provided.
### Fixed
- branch submit: The --draft flag is no longer ignored. Whether a PR is draft or not will be changed on each submit.
- {downstack, stack} submit: Don't change draft status of existing PRs. Use `branch submit --[no-]draft` to do that.
- Fix issue where some operations printed rebase conflict message two or more times.
- rebase {continue, abort}: Heal from external `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort` and avoid running old rebase continuation commands.
- branch checkout: Fix trunk branch not showing in branch selection prompt.

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta2">v0.1.0-beta2</a> - 2024-06-01
### Added
- branch rename: Support renaming another branch by name with the `branch rename <old> <new>` form of the command.
### Changed
- (*Breaking*) Change shorthand for 'branch delete' to 'bd'.
- (*Breaking*) Change shorthand for 'branch rename' to 'brn'.
- rebase continue: Don't run continuations if a rebase wasn't in progress. This avoids unexpected behavior from lefotver state.
- branch checkout: Prompt for picking a branch only shows tracked branches by default. Use -u/--untracked to also see untracked branches.
- branch submit: Auto-detect PRs created outside git-spice, e.g. using the GitHub UI.
### Fixed
- repo sync: Fix failure if the worktree has uncommitted changes.
- branch delete: Don't fail if the repository is in detached HEAD state.
- branch delete: Fix repository left on the wrong branch if upstacks were restacked.
- GitHub URL detection now respects non-standard URLs like GHES set via `$GITHUB_URL`.

## <a name="v0.1.0-beta1">v0.1.0-beta1</a> - 2024-05-28
### Added
- Add `gs rebase continue` (alias `gs rbc`) and `gs rebase abort` (alias `gs rba`) to continue git-spice operations interrupted by rebase conflicts.
- Add 'upstack onto' command to move a branch and its upstack onto a new base. This was previously the behavior of 'branch onto'.
### Changed
- branch {edit, onto}: Support continuing the operation after resolving conflicts with `gs rebase continue`.
- {branch, upstack, stack} restack: Support continuing the operation after resolving conflicts with `gs rebase continue`.
- (*Breaking*) branch onto: Extract only the commits of the target branch onto the new base. The upstack will be rebased to point to its base. Use 'upstack onto' to graft the entire upstack onto the new base.
- (*Breaking*) branch delete: Remove commits of the deleted branch from the stack. If you want to keep them around, untrack the branch instead.
- branch delete: In the selection prompt for deleting a branch, default to the current branch. 
### Fixed
- Reduce boilerplate in rebase error messages.
- branch delete: Don't report an empty hash for untracked branches.
