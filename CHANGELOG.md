## v0.1.0-beta1 - 2024-05-28
### Added
- Add `gs rebase continue` (alias `gs rbc`) and `gs rebase abort` (alias `gs rba`) to continue git-spice operations interrupted by rebase conflicts.
- Add 'upstack onto' command to move a branch and its upstack onto a new base. This was previously the behavior of 'branch onto'.
### Changed
- branch {edit, onto}: Support continuing the operation after resolving conflicts with `gs rebase continue`.
- {branch, upstack, stack} restack: Support continuing the operation after resolving conflicts with `gs rebase continue`.
- (*Breaking*) branch onto: Extract only the commits of the target branch onto the new base. The upstack will be rebased to point to its base. Use 'upstack onto' to graft the entire upstack onto the new base.
- (*Breaking*) branch delete: Remove commits of the deleted branch from the stack. If you want to keep them around, untrack the branch instead.
- branch delete: In the selection prompt for deleting a branch, default to the current branch. 
### Fixed
- Reduce boilerplate in rebase error messages.
- branch delete: Don't report an empty hash for untracked branches.

## v0.1.0-alpha5 - 2024-05-27
### Added
- branch {checkout, delete, onto, rename}: Prompt for branch if not provided.
- branch checkout: Allow opting into tracking after checking out a branch.
### Changed
- Use more compact UI for terminal widgets.
- branch submit: Replace inline text editor with option to open `$EDITOR` or accept the default.
- Selection widgets now support fuzzy filtering. Start typing to filter options.

## v0.1.0-alpha4 - 2024-05-24
### Added
- commit create, commit amend: Allow using during an ongoing rebase. During a rebase, these commands will not restack the upstack.
- repo sync: Support running in detached head state.
### Changed
- *Breaking*: Change restack alias to 'r', allowing for 'br', 'sr', 'usr', etc.
### Fixed
- Adjust restacking commit selection to avoid picking up extraneous commits.
- branch submit: Don't truncate PR bodies longer than 400 characters.
- branch edit: Fix not surfacing the editor to the user.

## v0.1.0-alpha3 - 2024-05-23
### Changed
- branch delete: Report hash of deleted branch. Use this to recover the deleted branch before the next `git gc`.
- Rename 'gs complete' to 'gs completion'.
### Fixed
- repo sync: Fix deleting merged branches after a manual 'git pull'.

## v0.1.0-alpha2 - 2024-05-23
### Fixed
- branch submit: Fix default PR title and body for branches with multiple commits.
- repo sync: Delete remote tracking branches for merged PRs.
